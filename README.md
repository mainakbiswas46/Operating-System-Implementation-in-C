# Operating System Implementation in C

This repository contains an implementation of core operating system concepts using the C programming language. The project is designed for educational purposes, aiming to provide clear examples and code for fundamental OS components. It is ideal for students, educators, and anyone interested in learning how an operating system works at a low level.

## Features

- **Process Management**: Creation, scheduling, and termination of processes.
- **Memory Management**: Allocation, deallocation, and memory protection.
- **File System**: Basic file operations and management.
- **Device Drivers**: Simple I/O device simulation and drivers.
- **Inter-process Communication (IPC)**: Mechanisms for process synchronization and communication.
- **Shell/Command Interface**: A basic shell for interacting with the OS.
